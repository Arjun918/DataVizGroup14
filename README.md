# DataVizGroup14
Data Visualization Final Project Group 14

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of global fertility trends from 1960 to 2021, focusing on the intricate relationship between fertility rates, GDP per capita, and life expectancy.

Our research utilizes datasets sourced from the World Bank, processed and analyzed through a combination of R and Tableau. The repository includes an R Markdown (Rmd) file that details our methodology for loading and manipulating these datasets using R. This file serves as a guide to the initial stages of our analysis, including data cleaning and preliminary exploration. For ease of viewing and sharing, we have also provided an HTML knitted version of the Rmd file, which offers a user-friendly format for reviewing our analysis and findings. Additionally, we have incorporated several Tableau workbooks that feature a range of insightful graphs and visualizations. These visualizations not only highlight the historical trends in fertility rates but also elucidate the correlations between fertility rates and key indicators.

Our project aims to provide a clear and detailed picture of how these variables have interacted over the past six decades, offering valuable insights for researchers, policy-makers, and anyone interested in demographic and socio-economic trends.
